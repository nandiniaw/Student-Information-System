# Student Information System – Week 1 Documentation

## 1. Project Overview

### Project Title
Student Information System

### Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a basic console-based Student Information System using Java.  
The system allows users to add student records and view all stored records through a menu-driven interface.

### Scope (Week 1)
- Add new student records
- View all student records

### Out of Scope
- Search functionality
- Update or delete operations
- File handling or database storage
- Input validation utilities

---

## 2. Technologies Used

- Programming Language: Java
- Data Structure: ArrayList
- Input Handling: Scanner
- Development Environment: Any Java IDE / Command Prompt

## 4. Description of Classes

### Student.java
- Represents a student entity
- Stores student details such as:
  - Student ID
  - Name
  - Age
  - Grade
  - Contact
- Uses encapsulation with private variables and public getter methods

---

### StudentManager.java
- Manages the collection of students
- Uses an ArrayList to store student objects
- Provides methods to:
  - Add a student
  - Retrieve all students
  - Check if the list is empty

---

### StudentInformationSystem.java
- Contains the `main()` method
- Provides a menu-driven user interface
- Handles user input and program flow
- Interacts with Student and StudentManager classes

---

## 5. User Instructions

### Main Menu Options
1. Add Student  
2. View Students  
3. Exit  

### Add Student
- User enters student ID, name, age, grade, and contact
- The student record is stored in memory

### View Students
- Displays all stored student records in tabular format
- Displays a message if no records are available

### Exit
- Terminates the program safely

---

## 6. Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Add Student
**Input:**
- ID: ST001
- Name: Rahul
- Age: 20
- Grade: 8.5
- Contact: 9876543210

**Expected Output:**
- Student added successfully message

---

### Test Case 2: View Students
**Input:**
- Select option 2

**Expected Output:**
- Displays student details in table format

---

### Test Case 3: Empty Student List
**Condition:**
- View students without adding any records

**Expected Output:**
- Message: "No students found"

---

## 7. Limitations

- Data is not stored permanently
- No validation is performed on user input
- Data is lost when the program exits

---

## 8. Conclusion

This Week 1 Student Information System demonstrates basic Java programming concepts including classes, objects, ArrayList usage, and user interaction through the console.  
It provides a strong foundation for adding advanced features in future weeks.

---

## 9. Future Enhancements

- Input validation using utility classes
- Search student by ID
- Update and delete student records
- File handling or database integration
